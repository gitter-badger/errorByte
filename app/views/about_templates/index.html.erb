				<p class="aboutp">Why errorByte?  As a student of life, I am constantly learning and improving.  Personally, what I found to be the greatest lessons are those when I encounter drawbacks.</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="abouttitle">What I want to accomplish with errorByte</h3>
				<p class="aboutp">While coding, these drawbacks translate directly into errors.  I believe that everyone should try and encounter as much errors as possible.  I hope this app will empower beginner coders as much as I did while creating those errors.  Catch all the errors!</p>
